“$1,500.00                 IPO Project Management Fee (One-time set up)

$833.33                    Per Month”

3.    Amendment of the Agreement. In order that the Series E Preferred may be designated as a new class of Shares under the Agreement, including, without limitation, any and all schedules and exhibits thereto, the Fund agrees and binds itself to the terms and conditions thereof with respect to the Series E Preferred and acknowledges that by its execution and delivery of this Amendment it shall assume all of the obligations and shall be entitled to all of the rights, duties and obligations of a Company with respect to a class of Shares, as if the Series E Preferred were an original designated class of Shares under the Agreement.

4.    Exhibit. Exhibit A is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with the new Exhibit A attached hereto, which reflects the addition of the Series E Preferred to the Agreement.

5.    Capitalized Terms. Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the same meaning as set forth in the Agreement.
